# edf2eigen

I'm trying to convert ```.edf``` file into Eigen.

## ⚠️Warning

I can't guarantee that this program will work properly. If not, I'm not responsible for that.

So, use it carefully.

## File

**nk2edf.c:**

From [https://github.com/mattja/nk2edf](https://github.com/mattja/nk2edf), which can convert the ```.eeg``` to the common format ```.edf```.

**edf2ascii.c:**

From [https://github.com/Balashov1337/edf2ascii](https://github.com/Balashov1337/edf2ascii), which can convert the ```.edf``` to ```.txt```.

**edf2eigen.cpp**

Changed by [Me](https://github.com/LetMeFly666) from ```edf2ascii.c```.


Enjoy it.
